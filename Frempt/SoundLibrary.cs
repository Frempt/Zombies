	Description:	- Used to statically play sound effects and music. 
	
					- All SoundEffects are stored in arrays, which are filled by calling LoadSound(string, int) and passing the filename (without numeration) and the amount of effects to be loaded.
                    - It's important to ensure there are that many sounds in the content folder under that filename (default format for naming is "filename0").
					
					- The functions for playing a sound choose one at random from the array. For instance, calling the static function PlayerShoot() will choose a sound from the playerShoot array and play it.
